\title{Cross-validation for Multi-Fit Model}
\usage{
cv_multiFit(
  xmat,
  ymat,
  xmat_list = NULL,
  nfold = 5,
  method,
  family = family,
  dist1 = NULL,
  weights = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{xmat}{Matrix of predictors, each row is an observation vector.}

\item{ymat}{Matrix of outcomes (quantitative for family = "gaussian", factor of two levels for family = "binomial", survival object for family = "survival").}

\item{xmat_list}{A list of predictor matrices (optional).}

\item{nfold}{Integer, number of folds for cross-validation.}

\item{method}{A model fitting method or a list of methods for each outcome.}

\item{family}{The response type for each response (can be "gaussian", "binomial", or "survival").}

\item{dist1}{Assumed distribution for survival response (optional).}

\item{weights}{Weights for the survival response (optional).}
}
\value{
A list containing the fitted models, predictions, and other model details.
}
\description{
Use cross-validation to evaluate a multi-fit model's performance.
}
\details{
The function performs cross-validation using different methods for fitting models and evaluates them based on the family type (gaussian, binomial, survival).
}
\examples{
cv_multiFit(xmat = XX, ymat = YY, family = "gaussian", nfold = 2, method = rpart1)
}
